# CS 61BL

CS 61BL teaches you the data structures and algorithms and is an essential background for software engineering and the rest of the CS program at UC Berkeley.

To get started:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Most of the codebase cannot be run in a CLI environment, you'll need IntelliJ IDEA to run things like JUnit tests.
